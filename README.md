# Bias-Variance-Trade-off-in-Kalman-Filter-Based-Disturbance-Observers
This is a demo code for the paper "Bias-Variance Trade-off in Kalman Filter-Based Disturbance Observers".

# Platform
MATLAB 2023a

# Overview
In this repository, we investigate the bias-variance effects in Kalman filter-based disturbance observers using four examples, including vehicle tracking, 1-DOF torsion system, 1-DOF manipulator, and experiments on an exoskeleton robot. In these examples, we use SISE and KF-DOB as benchmarks and compare them with MKCKF-DOB and IMMKFDOB. 

# Codes 
A total of four examples are involved in this repository: vehicle tracking, 1-DOF torsion system, 1-DOF manipulator, and exoskeleton angle tracking. 
The code can be executed by clicking the corresponding .m file.
