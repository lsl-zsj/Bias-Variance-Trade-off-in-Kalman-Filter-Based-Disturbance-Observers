# Bias-Variance-Trade-off-in-Kalman-Filter-Based-Disturbance-Observers
This repository contains the demo code for the paper "Bias-Variance Trade-off in Kalman Filter-Based Disturbance Observers".

# Platform
MATLAB 2023a

# Overview
We investigate the bias-variance effects in Kalman filter-based disturbance observers using four examples:
1: Vehicle tracking
2: 1-DOF torsion system
3: 1-DOF manipulator
4: Exoskeleton robot experiments
In these examples, we use SISE and KF-DOB as benchmarks and compare them against MKCKF-DOB and IMMKFDOB.

# Instructions 
To run the code, execute the corresponding .m files in MATLAB.
